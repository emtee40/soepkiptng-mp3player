     ----------------------------------------------------

Download:
---------
A daily cvs snapshot .tar.gz is available from
http://www.lammerts.org/software/soepkiptng/.

Direct (read-only) cvs access is also possible. Set your CVSROOT to
:pserver:anonymous@lammerts.org:/var/local/cvs, do "cvs login"
(empty password) and "cvs checkout soepkiptng".


Features:
---------
* supports mp3 (+id3/id3v2), wav, lpac, flac & Ogg-Vorbis audio files.
* supports playing Shoutcast streams.
* player uses real-time scheduling and memory locking for uninterrupted music
  playback; zero silence period between two songs (very nice for consecutive
  songs of a live cd).
* song information is kept in a MySQL database, but can be written back
  to mp3s (using ID3v2) too.
* plays from request queue; plays random songs if nothing is on the request
  queue
* versatile web interface:
  + supports browsing, searching, requesting songs,
    killing current song, editing song information etc.
  + very fast (thanks to mod_perl)
  + configurable look (CSS style)
  + tested with Netscape, Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera & MSIE.
* commandline interface


Requirements:
-------------
* perl5
* mysql 3.22
  (3.23 recommended; 3.22 cannot do case-insensitive regexps)
* apache + mod_perl
* perl modules:
  - MPEG::MP3Info
  - CGI
  - DBI
  - DBD::mysql
  - Compress::Zlib
  - Apache::DBI
  - Apache::Session
  - TermReadKey (optional)
* programs for decoding the various sound formats:
  - mp3: mpg123 and splay
  - wav: for instance splay
  - lpac:
    LPAC is a non-free lossless compression algorithm. You can get a linux
    binary from http://www-ft.ee.tu-berlin.de/~liebchen/lpac.html at no cost.
    The source is not available :-(.
  - flac:
    Flac is a free lossless compression algorithm, available from
    flac.sourceforge.net. It does not compress as well as lpac, but the
    difference is marginal.
  - Ogg-Vorbis
    Get the libraries from http://www.xiph.org.


On a Debian system you can install all the necessary software with apt-get:

apt-get install libapache-mod-perl libapache-dbi-perl libdbd-mysql-perl \
   mysql-server libmpeg-mp3info-perl libterm-readkey-perl \
   libcompress-zlib-perl splay mpg123 libvorbis-dev flac

Perl modules can be installed directly from CPAN by starting "perl -MCPAN
-e shell" (you must answer some configuration questions if you do this for
the first time) and typing "install Some::Module".


Installation:
-------------
* compile the helper applications:
  cd src; make; sudo make install
  The binaries will be placed in the 'bin' subdirectory.
* create the database:
  sudo mysql -u root < soepkiptng_create.my
* reload the grant tables:
  sudo mysqladmin reload
* cp soepkiptng.conf /etc
  (or edit all scripts if you want a different location)
* edit /etc/soepkiptng.conf
* make the directory /var/local/soepkiptng and make sure
  it's writable for the user that will run soepkiptngd
* Add something like the following to /etc/apache/httpd.conf:

  Alias /soepkiptng /usr/local/soepkiptng/web

  <Directory /usr/local/soepkiptng/web>
    Options +ExecCGI
    DirectoryIndex index.cgi
    AddHandler perl-script .cgi
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    PerlRequire /usr/local/soepkiptng/modperl.pl
    PerlSendHeader On
  </Directory>

* run soepkiptng_update to add songs to the database
* run soepkiptngd -d to start playing with debugging on.
  If everything works alright, start it without -d to run it in the
  background. Debugging output is then sent to
  /var/local/soepkiptng/soepkiptng.err, which is automatically
  rotated if the size reaches 64Kbyte. Make sure file permissions
  in /var/local/soepkiptng are OK. If you sometimes run soepkiptngd as root
  and sometimes as non-root you can expect problems.
 

TODO:
-----
* 'see also' feature for related artists
* clean up Shoutcast support (separate table, multiple urls per name with
  automatic fallback)
* lirc support (IR remote)
* play directly from urls
* playlists/genres
* ripping integration
* multiple soepkiptng daemons
* remote playing using esd (Enlightenment Sound Daemon) or similar program
* message input that will be played using a text-to-speech program
* user-level access control (limit access to database editing / song requests)
* improve docs
* make music format more modular; maybe support xmms plugins
* silence before random songs
* fade-out/fade-in in pause/resume
* release of /dev/dsp during pause
* cleanup Xing VBR info detection (it's a quick hack now)
* scan VBR mp3s without Xing VBR header for length
* Ogg-Vorbis embedded songinfo support (reading/writing)
* cleanup resampling & mono->stereo conversion
* smooth transition between 2 songs (interpolation)
* id3/id3v2 support for flac
* synchronize update of statusfile with cdrplay
