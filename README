Features:
---------
* mp3, wav, lpac & Ogg-Vorbis support.
* (My)SQL database with songs.
* nice web interface
* commandline interface

Requirements: (you can get things with (*) from my homepage)
-------------
* perl5
* mysql 3.22
  (3.23 recommended; 3.22 cannot do case-insensitive regexps)
* apache + mod_perl
* perl modules:
  - MP3-Info (optional)
  - CGI
  - DBI
  - ApacheDBI
  - Msql-Mysql-modules
  - TermReadKey (optional)
* cdrplay(*)
* resample(*)
* programs that decode the various sound formats to standard output:
  - mp3: get mp3toraw(*) and mpg123
  - wav: for instance splay
  - lpac:
    LPAC is a lossless compression algorithm. You can get a linux binary
    from http://www-ft.ee.tu-berlin.de/~liebchen/lpac.html. No source
    is available :-(.
    Also get lpac2raw(*)
  - Ogg-Vorbis:
    Unfortunately ogg123 cannot play to standard output.
    Get the libraries from http://www.xiph.org and ogg2raw(*)


On a Debian system,
   apt-get install libapache-mod-perl libapache-dbi-perl libdbd-mysql-perl \
      mysql-server libmpeg-mp3info-perl libterm-readkey-perl \
      splay libvorbis-dev
will install all the necessary software (except the programs marked with (*)).


Installation:
-------------
* create the database:
  sudo mysql -u root < soepkiptng_create.my
* reload the grant tables:
  sudo mysqladmin reload
* cp soepkiptng.conf /etc
  (or edit all scripts if you want a different location)
* edit /etc/soepkiptng.conf
* make the directory /var/local/soepkiptng and make sure
  it's writable for the user that will run soepkiptngd
* Add something like the following to /etc/apache/httpd.conf:

  Alias /soepkiptng /usr/local/soepkiptng/web

  <Directory /usr/local/soepkiptng/web>
    Options +ExecCGI
    DirectoryIndex index.cgi
    AddHandler perl-script .cgi
    PerlHandler Apache::Registry
    PerlRequire /usr/local/soepkiptng/modperl.pl
    PerlSendHeader On
  </Directory>

* run soepkiptng_update to add songs to the database
* run soepkiptngd -d to start playing with debugging on.
  If everything works alright, start it without -d to run it in the
  background. Debugging output is then sent to
  /var/local/soepkiptng/soepkiptng.err, which is automatically
  rotated if the size reaches 64Kbyte.
 

TODO:
-----
* improve docs
* make music format more modular; maybe support xmms plugins
* silence before random songs
* fade-out/fade-in in pause/resume
* release of /dev/dsp during pause
* get correct info for VBR mp3's                   ->partially done
* ogg-vorbis support                               ->done
* reading of samplefreq/channels of lpac files.    ->done
* resampling & mono->stereo conversion	           ->done (quick hack)
* smooth transition between 2 songs (interpolation)
* id3/id3v2 support				   ->done (id3)
* synchronize update of statusfile with cdrplay
* if currently playing song is missing from db, show "?" instead of nothing ->done
* fix kill problem when player spawns children	   ->done
* don't randomly select songs that were played less than min_random_time ago ->done
