Features:
---------
* file format support:
  - MP3 (including id3/id3v2 tag reading, id3v2 tag writing)
  - Ogg-Vorbis (including Vorbis comment reading/writing)
  - flac (including Vorbis comment reading/writing)
  - CD/DA (reading directly from CD, using cdparanoia)
  - wav
  - raw (headerless 44.1kHz/16bit/2ch/little-endian files)
  - Video (everything supported by MPlayer: MPEG, AVI, ASF, WMV, Quicktime,
    RealMedia and more)
  - midi/mod (using TiMidity++)
  - Shorten
  - AC3
  - MP4 (AAC, ALAC)
  - WMA & RealAudio (all formats that are supported by your mplayer)
  - Musepack (SV7 only)
* supports playing Shoutcast streams (MP3 / Ogg Vorbis)
* supports playing back in 32-bit mode
* player uses real-time scheduling and memory locking for uninterrupted music
  playback; zero silence period between two songs (very nice for consecutive
  songs of a live cd).
* song information is kept in a MySQL database, but can be written back
  to mp3 files (using ID3v2) or ogg/flac files (using vorbis comments) too.
* lyrics support; Lyrics can be entered manually or downloaded automatically
  from http://www.purelyrics.com and http://www.lyricsdomain.com.
  They can be read from and written to mp3 files using id3v2 tags.
* volume correction to avoid clipping
* plays from request queue; plays random songs if nothing is on the request
  queue
* versatile web interface:
  - supports browsing, searching, requesting songs,
    killing current song, editing song information etc.
  - very fast (thanks to mod_perl)
  - configurable look (CSS style)
  - tested with Netscape, Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera & MSIE.
* commandline interface
* partial emulation of a Music Player Daemon on port 6600
  (http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/), for use with Conky
  (http://conky.sourceforge.net/)


Requirements:
-------------
* perl5
* mysql 3.22
  (3.23 recommended; 3.22 cannot do case-insensitive regexps)
* perl modules:
  - MP3::Tag
  - MPEG::MP3Info
  - CGI
  - DBI
  - DBD::mysql
  - Compress::Zlib
  - BSD::Resource (optional)
  - TermReadKey (optional)
  - CDDB_get (optional)
* programs for decoding the various sound formats:
  - mp3: madplay >= 0.15.0 (http://www.mars.org/home/rob/proj/mpeg/)
  - midi/mod: TiMidity++ (http://www.goice.co.jp/member/mo/timidity/)
  - wav, flac, ogg, ac3, aac, alac, shorten, ape: mplayer
  - wav, flac, ogg, m4a: sox (optional)
  - CD/DA: requires cdparanoia (http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/)
  - Video: requires MPlayer (http://http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
* programs for tag reading/writing:
  - flac: metaflac
  - ogg: ogginfo, vorbiscomment

The webinterface used to run under Apache using mod_perl, but I've switched
to running as a separate webserver. The Apache method may still work, but is
now completely untested.

Perl modules can be installed directly from CPAN by starting "perl -MCPAN
-e shell" (you must answer some configuration questions if you do this for
the first time) and typing "install Some::Module".


On a Debian or Ubuntu system you can install all the necessary software with
apt-get.

Package list:
- libcompress-zlib-perl
- libdbd-mysql-perl
- libmp3-tag-perl
- libmpeg-mp3info-perl or libmp3-info-perl
- libterm-readkey-perl    (optional)
- mysql-server
- madplay                 (for mp3 support)
- mplayer
- flac                    (for flac support; >= 1.04)
- vorbis-tools            (for Ogg-Vorbis support)
- libwww-perl
- cdparanoia              (optional; for CD-DA support)
- libcddb-get-perl        (optional; for CD-DA support)


Installation:
-------------
* compile the helper applications:
  cd src; make; sudo make install
  The binaries will be placed in the 'bin' subdirectory.
* create the database:
  sudo mysql -u root < soepkiptng_create.my
* reload the grant tables:
  sudo mysqladmin reload
* copy soepkiptng.conf.example to either:
  - /etc/soepkiptng.conf
  - ~/.soepkiptng.conf
  - any file named in $SOEPKIPTNG_CONFIGFILE
  (or edit soepkiptng.lib if you want a different location)
* edit the config file to taste
* make the directory /var/local/soepkiptng and make sure
  it's writable for the user that will run soepkiptngd
* run soepkiptng_update to add songs to the database
* run soepkiptngd -d to start playing with debugging on.
  If everything works alright, start it without -d to run it in the
  background. Debugging output is then sent to
  /var/local/soepkiptng/soepkiptng.err, which is automatically rotated if
  the size reaches 64Kbyte. Make sure file permissions in
  /var/local/soepkiptng are OK. If you sometimes run soepkiptngd as root and
  sometimes as non-root you can expect problems.
* run soepkiptng_httpd -d to start the webinterface. By default it runs on
  port 8888. 
  If everything works alright, start it without -d to run it in the
  background.
* for status display through conky, put something like this in your .conkyrc:
    ${mpd_artist} - ${mpd_title} (${mpd_album}, \#${mpd_track}) ${mpd_elapsed}/${mpd_length}
  If you don't want soepkiptngd to listen on port 6600, add mpd_port=0 to
  the config file.


TODO:
-----
* write man pages for all scripts & executables
* better interface / web interface for 'see also' feature
* clean up Shoutcast support (separate table, multiple urls per name with
  automatic fallback)
* lirc support (IR remote)
* play directly from urls
* smb support (playing/updating directly from Windoze shares)
* playlists/genres
* ripping integration
* multiple soepkiptng daemons & request queues
* remote playing using esd (Enlightenment Sound Daemon), http streaming or
  similar stuff
* message input that will be played using a text-to-speech program
* user-level access control (limit access to database editing / song requests)
* improve docs
* make music format more modular; maybe support xmms plugins (well, they suck)
* silence before random songs
* fade-out/fade-in in pause/resume
* cleanup Xing VBR info detection (it's a quick hack now)
* scan VBR mp3s without Xing VBR header for length
* Ogg-Vorbis embedded songinfo support (reading/writing)
* cleanup resampling & mono->stereo conversion
* smooth transition between 2 songs (interpolation)
* synchronize update of statusfile with cdrplay
* CD-DA support: don't re-enter info into db every time you click "CD-DA"
  maybe use persistent info and cddb disc_id?
